# Parts
The body of each thumb cluster is made up of a top and bottom half. In addition there is an attachment part to join the thumb cluster to the main keyboard body at an adjustable angel. An optional (but recommended) support strut part is offered in two variation, short and long to further secure the thumb cluster. Finally the mx-spacer is not stictly necessary to use but provides some additional securement for mx keys and a surface to attach pcb to. 

## Support strut short
Variant of the support sturt compatible with angles between 15-45 degrees.

## Support strut long
Variant of the support sturt compatible with angles between 15-75 degrees.
*note that this still isn't long enough to support the 90 degreee position; it simply seemed to extreme an angle and the part already allows for more rotation than I'll ever use.

## Thumb Attachement 
Part that joins the thumb cluster and main keyboard body together. Allows for angle of attachement to be set between 0-90 degrees in 15 degree increments.

## Thumb Bottom 
Connects to Thumb Attachement via one M2, one M3 screws/threaded insert, and to top via six M2 screws/inserts. Went kinda overboard with threaded attachement points; not all these are sticty needed to be secure, could easily get away with using just three or two. 

## Thumb Top
Connects to Support strut via M3 screws/threaded insert. Switch plate allows for either MX or Choc switches.

Of possible interest might be my [Enigam Dual Hot Swap](https://github.com/mroukema/enigma-dual-hs) single key pcb.

## MX Spacer
Not required but useful for adapting the swich plate height and to provied a surface to glue a pcb to if you wish to be able to hot swap switches with zero disassembly. 

If outsourcing your 3D printing you may find that these end up being priced as the minumum unit cost, meaning you are mostly paying for handing fees not the actual printing. It would be best to batch a bunch of these together by a connecting them with thin bridge and cut them away later.
