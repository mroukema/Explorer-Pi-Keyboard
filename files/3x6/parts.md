# Parts
The main body of the keyboard is made up of a top and bottom half for each keyboard half. There are two variations on the bottom half explained below; choose one.

## Case Bottom Default
This default version of the bottom half of the case has the 1/4" mounting point in the same position as the V1 model; it's centered on the middle finger column. 

This version also has the holes required to attach both the battery and front mount accessory parts. 

## Case Bottom Offset (still untested)
The offset version of the bottom half of the case has the 1/4" mounting hole shifted down and toward the pinky column. This (hopefully) shifts the center of balance enough to allow for typing without tipping on a ~2.5" dia stand.  

This version does not have any holes for battery of front mount accessory parts. 

## Case Top

Top of case and MX switch plate.
